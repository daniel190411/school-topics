<ul>
	<li>In August 55 B.C. (55 years before Jesus was born) the Roman general, Emperor Julius Caesar invaded Britain. He took with him two Roman legions. After winning several battles against the Celtic tribes (Britons) in south-east England he returned to France.</li>
	<li>The following summer (in 54 B.C.) Caesar came to Britain again landing at Walmer near Deal in Kent. This time he brought with him no fewer than five legions (30,000 foot soldiers) and 2,000 cavalrymen (horse riders). This time the Romans crossed the River Thames. After more fighting, the British tribes promised to pay tribute to Rome and were then left in peace for nearly a century.</li>
	<li>Third and final invasion. Nearly one hundred years later, in 43 A.D. (43 years after Jesus was born), Emperor Claudius organised the final and successful Roman invasion of Britain. General Aulus Plautius led four legions with 25,000 men, plus an equal number of auxiliary soldiers. They crossed the Channel in three divisions, landing at Richborough, Dover, and Lympne.</li>
	<li>Many tribes tried to resist the Romans. It took about four years for the invaders to finally gain control over southern England, and another 30 years for them to conquer all of the West Country and the mountains and valleys of Wales. The battle for Yorkshire and the remainder of northern England was still underway in AD 70.</li>
	<li>The Romans remained in  Britain from 43 AD to 410 AD. That is almost four hundred years (four centuries).</li>

<ul> 
	<li>Diana was the goddess of the hunt. The daughter of the Roman god JUPITER</li>
	<li>, Diana was also revered as the goddess of the woods, children and childbirth, fertility, chastity, the moon, and wild animals. Her worshippers believed she had the power to talk to woodland animals and even control their movements and behavior.</li>
	<li>Diana was Apollo's twin sister</li>
	<li>If there was only one thing you could say about Diana, it would probably be that Diana guarded her privacy. She did not like people invading her space.</li>
</ul>
